This is the accompanying data for the Current Biology article titled "Selecting for altered substrate specificity reveals the evolutionary flexibility of ATP-binding cassette transporters" authored by Sriram Srikant, Rachelle Gaudet and Andrew W Murray (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.077). The sequence alignment and homology models presented here support the inferences made in our manuscript. The autocrine data presented here is the raw data supporting our figures.
